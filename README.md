# Starting up
Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the frontend. It will be found at http://localhost:3000. Also you can build the the frontend and place the build content inside backend's client folder. By doing this both frontend and backend will run from a same server.

# Folder structure
This project maintains a feature based folder structure where each feature folder is like a src folder. Means it will have it's own components, context, reducers etc in it. On the other hand everything outside features is globally used tools,styles, etc or not any feature specific thing.
